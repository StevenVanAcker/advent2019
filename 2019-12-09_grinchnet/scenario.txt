Knock, knock...
Who's there?
No, there are no Whos here! Hahahaha!! :D Get it??
I HATE WHOS!
Oh, we didn't realize it was you, mr. Grinch!
Who did you expect?? Santa?! How are the plans coming along to ruin Christmas?
Right on track, they don't suspect a thing! We even routed our communication lines through Santa's Christmas tree!
You did what!? I hope this doesn't come back to bite us...
No worries, everything will be fine! Oh, we need the activation code for the Steal-Gifts-O-Tron
Ah right, the code is AOTW{Th3y_w1ll_n3v3r_s33_1t_c0m1ng}. Now get back to work!
Yes sir!
