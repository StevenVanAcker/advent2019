A smart elf at NICE (the North-pole's Intelligence Community of Examiners)
noticed that the lights in Santa's Christmas tree were blinking in a weird
pattern and made a recording.  By pulling on the wires really hard, we were
able to recover 2 identical micro-controllers, with ATmega328 written on them,
operating the lights.  We fear that NAUGHTY (the Network of Aides/Urchins of
the Grinch Hoping to Terminate Yule) is up to something, but we need your help
to investigate.
